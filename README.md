## Alice Synthesis Thirty

This repository contains a Python script for a simple chatbot powered by Google's Gemini large language model, integrated with Discord. 

### Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install google-generativeai`, `pip install discord.py`
3. Replace the placeholder API key in `config.py` with your actual Gemini API key.
4. Replace the placeholder TOKEN in `config.py` with your Discord bot token.
5. Run the script `main.py` to start the chatbot.

### Example Interaction

You: Hello, how are you?

Gemini: I am an AI language model, so I don't have feelings like humans do. However, I am here to assist you with any questions or tasks you may have.

### Note

This is a basic implementation, and further customization can be done to enhance the chatbot's capabilities and user experience.
